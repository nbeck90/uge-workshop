Donâ€™t supply a path?


Home Directory: /Users/nbeck

cd /
takes you to the root, every file leads from here (topmost)
Absolute path starts with a / (no ambiguity)
Generally, never delete anything from the root

ls
lists contents
pink - links
blue - folder
red - programs
ls -t (sorts by modification date, top down)
ls -l (sorts alphabetically, long format)
-r (reverses)

man
manual!

relative paths, as in, relative to where you are currently

.. means go up one directory
. tells you this current directory right now
subl . will open up your current directory in Sublime
